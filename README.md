## Description and Purpose:

### Premise:
The principal of Green-Valley High School has initiated an innovative project aimed at supporting Grade 12 learners who are struggling academically, with the goal of improving their grades. This initiative involves a two-month additional training program for Mathematics and English, designed to help prepare students for their end-of-year final examinations. The program will also include bi-monthly evaluations to monitor student progress and ensure continuous improvement.

### The Role of Bright Future:
To effectively track and enhance student performance throughout this program, the principal has approached KM Tech Innovations to develop an application named **BRIGHT FUTURE**. This application is specifically designed to track the performance of students enrolled in the program.

### Implementation Details:
For demonstration purposes, the application will initially track the progress of a maximum of five learners. The primary users of Bright Future will be the school's Learner Performance Evaluators (LPEs), who will use the application to monitor and support student progress.
Bright Future aims to provide a comprehensive solution to help students who are falling behind, ensuring they have the necessary tools and support to succeed in their final examinations.
